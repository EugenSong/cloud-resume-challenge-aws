<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Cloud Resume Challenge tasks participants with creating a resume website on AWS, incorporating various AWS services:

**Storage**: Utilized Amazon S3 for storing website files. Integrated DynamoDB for storing dynamic website data.

**Content Delivery**: Implemented Amazon CloudFront for improved website performance and reliability.

**DNS Management**: Registered a domain name through Amazon Route 53 and configured it to point to the CloudFront distribution.

**Serverless Functions**: Integrated AWS Lambda for handling dynamic elements like number of website visitors.

**Security & Monitoring**: Ensured security with SSL/TLS certificates and monitored using AWS CloudWatch.

**CI/CD Automation**: Employed GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), automating testing and deployments upon GitHub pushes.

**Infrastructure Provisioning**: Managed and provisioned infrastructure using Terraform, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across environments.

By leveraging these AWS services, GitHub Actions, and Terraform, I successfully completed the Cloud Resume Challenge, showcasing proficiency in cloud computing and web development.
